\chapter{Timeline and Resource Required}

\section{Timeline}
The project is split into 18 milestones, each showing a planned task, to make sure it completed effectively within 28 weeks (two semesters).

\vspace{0.5cm}
1. Identification of Metamorphic Properties and Relations
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify suitable metamorphic properties for regression models.
  \item Define metamorphic relations based on the expected outputs and how the inputs are changed.
  \item Check the identified relations using theoretical analysis.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
2. Design of Generalized Metamorphic Testing Template
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a universal, reusable template for metamorphic testing.
  \item Explain how to create, run, and check tests.
  \item Make sure the template can be easily adapted for other regression models.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
3. Proof of Concept (PoC) Development
\begin{itemize}
  \item Build a proof of concept to show that the proposed approach works.
  \item Test important metamorphic relations using sample regression models.
  \item Review the results and make any needed improvements to the design.
\end{itemize}

4. Development of Python Based Metamorphic Testing Framework
\begin{itemize}
  \item Build the main Python framework for metamorphic testing.
  \item Create modules to automatically generate and run test cases.
  \item Add metamorphic relations into the framework.
\end{itemize}

5. Experimental Evaluation
\begin{itemize}
  \item Set up tests to check the framework's efficacy.
  \item Execute experiments using regression models.
  \item Analyze the results to see how effectively faults are detected.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
6. Web Based Platform Development
\begin{itemize}
  \item Design and implement a web based platform for the testing framework.
  \item Allow users to run tests and view results.
  \item Connect the web platform with the backend framework.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
7. Documentation and Final Writing
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prepare detailed documentation of the system design and implementation.
  \item Write the chapters of the final project report.
  \item Make sure the report meets the university’s formatting requirements.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
8. Final Demonstration
\begin{itemize}
  \item Demonstrate the complete metamorphic testing system.
  \item Highlight the features of the web platform and key experimental results.
  \item Wrap up the project with a final evaluation and submission.
\end{itemize}
