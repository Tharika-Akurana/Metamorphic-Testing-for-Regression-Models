\chapter{Timeline and Resource Required}

\section{Timeline}
The project has been divided into 18 sequential milestones, each of which corresponds to the planned project activities, in order to guarantee its effective completion within the allotted time period of 28 weeks (two semesters).

1. Identification of Metamorphic Properties and Relations
\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify suitable metamorphic properties for regression models.
  \item Based on expected outputs and input transformations, define metamorphic relations.
  \item Validate identified relations through theoretical analysis.
\end{itemize}

2. Design of Generalized Metamorphic Testing Template
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a template for universal and reusable metamorphic testing.
  \item Describe the processes for creating, executing, and validating tests.
  \item Make sure it can be expanded to accommodate other regression models.
\end{itemize}

3. Proof of Concept (PoC) Development
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conduct a proof of concept to show that the suggested strategy is feasible.
  \item Use sample regression models to validate important metamorphic linkages.
  \item Examine PoC results and make any necessary design adjustments.
\end{itemize}

4. Development of Python Based Metamorphic Testing Framework
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop the core Python based metamorphic testing framework.
  \item Implement modules for the creation and execution of automated test cases.
  \item Integrate metamorphic relations into the framework.
\end{itemize}

5. Experimental Evaluation
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create test configurations to assess the framework's efficacy.
  \item Execute experiments using regression models.
  \item Evaluate the performance and capability of fault detection by analyzing the data.
\end{itemize}

6. Web Based Platform Development
\begin{itemize}
  \item Design and implement a web based platform for the testing framework.
  \item Enable user interaction for test execution and result visualization.
  \item Integrate the web platform with the backend testing framework.
\end{itemize}

7. Documentation and Final Writing
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prepare comprehensive documentation of system design and implementation.
  \item Write chapters of the final project report.
  \item Verify adherence to the formatting requirements of the university.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
8. Final Demonstration
\begin{itemize}
  \item Demonstrate the complete metamorphic testing system.
  \item Display the characteristics of the web based platform and experimental findings.
  \item Conclude the project with final evaluation and submission.
\end{itemize}
