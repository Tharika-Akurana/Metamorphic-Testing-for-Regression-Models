\chapter{Conclusion}

As autonomous driving systems become more popular, there is an increasing need for reliable and systematic testing methods to ensure that these models behave safely and consistently in real-world situations. Machine learning models used in self-driving cars, like those for predicting paths, steering, and staying in lanes, are hard to test because their outputs keep changing and there is no reliable way to check them. Traditional testing methods often fail to capture the complexity and variety of real-world driving situations, which makes it harder to trust the models when they are deployed.

This study proposes a general metamorphic testing platform designed specifically for regression models used in autonomous driving systems. Instead of checking for exact expected results, this method uses metamorphic testing to see if the outputs of several runs make sense together, helping to solve the oracle problem. This testing framework works with any model and allows different autonomous driving systems to be tested in an organized, reusable, and scalable way.

The Python framework and web interface make metamorphic testing easier and less manual. Tests with real autonomous driving models show it can catch issues that traditional methods might miss.

Overall, this work makes autonomous driving models more reliable and safer. The proposed testing platform connects model development with systematic validation and supports future research in testing AI-driven systems.
