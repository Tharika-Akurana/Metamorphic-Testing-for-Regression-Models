\section*{Abstract}

Autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on machine-learning regression models to perform important tasks like predicting vehicle trajectories, maintaining lanes, controlling steering, and planning vehicle movements. Although these models have improved a lot, it is still challenging to ensure their reliability and safety in real-world driving situations because of the test oracle problem. A test oracle is a mechanism that can systematically verify whether a test result is correct for a given input. However, a major challenge occurs when such an oracle does not exist or is too costly to use. This problem creates a major challenge because it makes verification difficult: it becomes impossible to clearly determine whether the continuous-valued output of a program is correct or incorrect for a given input. Furthermore, this creates methodological limitations, because the absence of a test oracle reduces the effectiveness of traditional test case selection methods that depend on known expected results. As a result, traditional testing is not sufficient to ensure reliable behavior in unexpected situations. To address this issue, alternative approaches like metamorphic testing are used. Instead of relying on a single predefined expected result, metamorphic testing verifies program correctness by examining relationships between inputs and outputs across multiple executions \cite{liu2014oracleMT}.

Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a useful approach to solve the test oracle problem by checking how a system behaves when inputs are changed in a controlled way. However, even though MT has been successfully used in other fields, it is not widely used in autonomous driving regression models because there is no common, reusable, and scalable testing framework.

This project focuses on designing and implementing a generic metamorphic testing platform specifically for the regression models used in autonomous driving systems. This approach makes it easier to create and check test cases without needing a specific test oracle. It uses a general metamorphic testing template that works with any model and includes common testing features. The framework is a Python system made of separate modules and is tested using real autonomous driving models and example tests. A web-based interface was also built to make the system easier to use and access for researchers and practitioners.

The proposed platform aims to make autonomous driving regression models more reliable, robust, and ready for real-world use. By reducing the need for manual testing and increasing test coverage, it helps make the deployment of self-driving car technology safer.
